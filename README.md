# Snipsnap - ultimate snippet handler for Visual Studio Code

[Snipsnap](https://snipsnap.dev/) is unopionated ultimate snippet handler that automatically exposes to you all available snippets for every library you are using in your project. Spend your time building great things, not orchestrating snippet extensions.

## Installation

Install through VS Code extensions. Search for `Snipsnap - Snippets Handler`

[Visual Studio Code Market Place: Snipsnap - snippets handler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snippsnap-vscode)

Can also be installed in VS Code: Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P), paste the following command, and press enter.

```
ext install snipsnap-vscode
```

## Configuration

No config required and more than that - no config even exists! You are good to go right after installing the extension.

## Usage

### Using Command Palette (CMD/CTRL + Shift + P)

No manual activation required as well, the extension triggers if your workspace folder contains `package.json` file and does magic on its own, but if you absolutely do, use

```
CMD + Shift + P -> Fetch the snippets
```

## Settings

Again, none exists.

## Error Messages

Reload using Command Paletter or just reload the window. If the problem hasn't dissapeared, please, [submit an issue with a description](https://github.com/snipsnap/snipsnap-vscode/issues).

## Telemetry

This extension respects the VS Code telemetry setting so if you have telemetry disabled in VS Code we will also not collect telemetry. See the [Visual Studio Code docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry#_disable-telemetry-reporting) for information on how to disable telemetry.

However, at this point 0 telemetry data is being gathered if you did not tweaked vscode telemetry settings.
